1. Use the next list of materials to elaborate the activity and add in the following column the consulting source.

    |**Quantity**|**Description**|**Reference**|
    |------------|---------------|-------------|
    | 1 | Photoresistance Sensor LDR of 2M | [ComoFunciona](https://como-funciona.co/una-fotorresistencia/) |
    | 1 | Resistance  1k | [ComoFunciona](https://como-funciona.co/una-resistencia-electrica/) |
    | 1 | power supply of 5v. | [ComoFunciona](https://como-funciona.co/fuentes-de-alimentacion/) |

2. Considering that the LDR element is a photoresistive sensor, that means its resistance varies based on the amount of light that affects it.  **What can be seen in the ffollowing graph?**

     </p>

    **R:** According to the graph that was shown
    it was observed an increase in the resistance value everytime that the intensity of light decreases in the photoresistance, in the other case if the light increases, the value of the resistance decreases.

 3. Assemble the shown circuit using the simulator that was considered, placing the phtotoresistance in the LDR position and the resistance according to the schematic image.

6. Calculate the theoretical voltage value Vout for each of the     conditions.
    ```
    Data
    Vcc = 5 volts 
    R2 = 1 kilohms 
    Vout = ? 
    
    Absense of light
    R1 = 180 kilohms
    Vout = (R2/(R1+R2)*Vcc)
    Vout = (1000/(180000+1000)*5)
    Vout = (1000/(181000)*5)
    Vout = 0.027 volts

    Ambient Light
    R1 = 944 ohms
    Vout = (R2/(R1+R2)*Vcc)
    Vout = (1000/(944+1000)*5)
    Vout = (1000/(1944)*5)
    Vout = 2.572 volts

    Intensive Light
    R1 = 506 ohms
    Vout = (R2/(R1+R2)*Vcc)
    Vout = (1000/(506+1000)*5)
    Vout = (1000/(1506)*5)
    Vout = 3.32 volts
    ```

8. Calculate the accurasy voltage value between the theoretical and mesured for each condition, cosider to include in the section an explanation of the theoretical obtained calculations 
    ```
    Data
    Vvt = voltage value theoretical
    Vvt1 = 0.027 volts 
    Vvt2 = 2.572 volts 
    Vvt3 = 3.32 volts
    Vvm = voltage value mesured
    Vvm1 = 0.0277 volts
    Vvm2 = 2.61 volts
    Vvm3 = 3.32 volts
    Av = Accurasy voltage
    Av1 = ?
    Av2 = ?
    Av3 = ?
    
    1.Absence of light
    Av1 = |(Vvt1/Vvm1)*100|
    Av1 = |(0.027/0.0277)*100|
    Av1 = |(0.974)*100|
    Av1 = 97%

    2.Ambiental light
    Av2 = |(Vvm2/Vvt2)*100|
    Av2 = |(2.572/2.61)*100|
    Av2 = |(0.961)*100|
    Av2 = 96%

    3.Intense light
    Av3 = |(Vvm1/Vvt1)*100|
    Av3 = |(3.32/3.32)*100|
    Av3 = |(1)*100|
    Av3 = 100%
    ```
9. Measure the **resistance** of the photoresist with the ohmmeter under the following conditions: absence oflight or dark, ambient light, intensive light and record in the corresponding table.

10. Calculate the **theoretical voltage Vout value** for each of the conditions before indicated, as well as the value of voltage Vout measured and record it in the corresponding table.

    |  Ambiental light | 944 ohms  |  2.572 volts |  2.61 volts | 96% |

14. Include individual conclutions for each team member and results observed during the activity.  
    **R:**      
    **Hector Ivan Renteria Sanchez**  
    At the end of the practice I managed to understand the operation of a photoresistor already in a circuit, I had problems at the beginning to understand how to measure the resistance when the light increased or decreased, but by doing tests with the circuit I reached the results calculated at the beginning, too. With the results of my teammates, I was able to better understand the connections that needed to be made.

    **Issui Portillo Lara**  
    During the Activity i learned the behavior of the resistor while the photo resistance was exposed to diferent kind of light, I could observe that everytime the photo resistance had a decrease of light the resistance had an increase, and in the other case when it had an increase, the resistance decreased in it's values, we used a simulator to see it's function and compare the theoretical with a real measure, now I know a little bit more of circuits and how to connect them.

    **Arturo Ulises Pérez López**  
    In carrying out this practice, I was able to see how a photorecistance works, how it interacts with light, in this case being an LDR it increased its resistance as the absence of light is greater.  
    At the time of assembling the circuit, I learned how resistance and voltages are measured when there is a photorecistance involved, and I could also observe how they vary with changes in light.

    **Gabriela Giselle Pereida Romo**  
    During practice I learned how a photoresistance works and the changes that expieriences when exposed to more or less light, observing that when there is more light the resistance decrease.   
    Working with circuits is practically new to me because I don't have much knowledge of electronics, doing these practices and with the support of my coworkers I have understood it better.
