2. Once the previous circuit is assembled, carry out a program that allows the assembly to comply with the following conditions: 
    - The system should be able to turn an LED on and off by pressing the touch sensor.
    - The system must have the characteristic that if the Led is on, when the touch sensor is touched, it will initiate an intermittent sequence of 3 seconds (that is, it turns off for 1 second, turns on for one second and finally turns off).
    - The system must have the characteristic that if the Led is off, when touching the touch sensor, it will turn on little by little until it reaches its maximum illumination level.

3. Place here evidence that you consider important during the development of the activity.  

    **R:**
    ```
    // set pin numbers
    const int touchPin = 4; 
    const int ledPin = 16;
    bool prenderApag= false;
    // setting PWM properties
    const int freq = 5000; // define a frequency of 5000 Hz
    const int ledChannel = 0; // choose channel 0 to generate the signal
    const int resolution = 8; // set a resolution of 8 bits
    // change with your threshold value
    const int threshold = 20;
    // variable for storing the touch pin value 
    int touchValue;

    void setup(){
        Serial.begin(115200);
        delay(1000); // give me time to bring up serial monitor
        // initialize the LED pin as an output:
        pinMode (ledPin, OUTPUT);
        // configure LED PWM functionalitites
        ledcSetup(ledChannel, freq, resolution); // (16,5000,8)
  
        // attach the channel to the GPIO to be controlled
        ledcAttachPin(ledPin, ledChannel); // (16,0)
  
    }

    void loop(){
        // read the state of the pushbutton value:
        touchValue = touchRead(touchPin);
        Serial.print(touchValue);
        if(touchValue < threshold)
        {
            if(digitalRead(ledPin))
            {
                Serial.println("Apagado");
                ledcWrite(ledChannel, 0);
                delay(1000);
                Serial.println("Encendido");
                ledcWrite(ledChannel, 255);
                delay(1000);
    
                Serial.println("Apagado");
                ledcWrite(ledChannel, 0); 
            }
            else
            {
                // turn LED on
                digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
                Serial.println("LED Encendido");
                // increase the LED brightness
                for(int dutyCycle = 0; dutyCycle <= 255; dutyCycle++){   
                // changing the LED brightness with PWM
                ledcWrite(ledChannel, dutyCycle); // (0,0++)
                delay(15);
                }
            }
        }
    else
    {
        Serial.println("LED Apagado");
    }
    delay(1000);
    }
    ```

9. Include the individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.
   
    **Hector Ivan Renteria Sanchez**  

    In this practice we had many problems with the code so that it could be executed correctly, we were all gathered as a team modifying the code and it did not show the expected result, after 1 day trying we managed to identify the problem that was the conditions in the LOOP. which made the LED always go off and on.


    **Issui Portillo Lara**  
    
    This time it was really hard to work with my teamates, but at the end we could make it work.
    I learned how to use an ESP32 node, and at the same time i worked with an ESP8266
    the thing is that without the circuit i had to investigate a lot to understand the code, we used a LED, resistor and the node
    After some changes, we could make the LED turn on, every time the pin 4(touch 0) was touched, it turned its light from low to strong
    We used frequency in 5000 to control this part, it was interesting. 


    **Arturo Ulises Perez Lopez**  

    The elaboration of this practice was very entertaining and fun since I had never worked with an ESP32 microcontroller, it was very entertaining to learn from it and know a little about its uses in this case how to use it to simulate a touch lamp with the help of the IDE Arduino to program the instructions that it is also compatible with that language. 


    **Gabriela Giselle Pereida Romo**  

    In this activity I learned how ESP32 works and how to use it with a LED to make a kind of lamp. It was difficult to support because I don't have the node to test the code that was needed, but thanks to my teammates I managed to understand the code and how the circuit works.
