    </p>

3. Carry out the program that allows through one of the Arduino's inputs, to receive the value registered by the **Ultrasonic Sensor** when approaching an object at different distances.

     
    **R:**  
    ```
    // C++ code
    //
    // Pin declaration 
    const int trigPin = 10; 
    const int echoPin = 9;


    //Declaration of variables
    long duracion;
    int distancia;

    void setup()
    {
        // Initialize pin
        pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
  
        // initialize the serial monitor 
        Serial.begin(9600);
    }

    void loop()
    {
        // Turn off the sensor 
        digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
        delayMicroseconds(2); // turn off the sensor for 2 micro seconds
  
        // TURN ON THE SENSOR SO THAT IT EMITS THE WAVE
        digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH); //turn on the sensor 
        delayMicroseconds(10); // send wave for 10 microseconds 
        digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); // turn off the sensor 
  
        // RECEIVE THE RETURN WAVE 
        duracion = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH); // save the duration of the wave's return
  
        // DISTANCE CONVERSION DURATION 
        distancia = (duracion*0.034)/2;
  
  
        // print the value of duration 
        Serial.println(distancia);
  
    }
   ```

4. Considering that the ultrasonic sensor has a minimum and maximum detection range based on the return time of the sonic signal, what values are obtained in the simulation under the **following conditions:**

    | Number    | Condition 1 | Condition 2 | Is the object detected?| 
    | ------------- |------------ | ------- |------------------------|
    | 1 | 5 cm distance to sensor | 0 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor|  Yes |
    | 2  |  50 cm distance to sensor | 35 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor | Yes |
    | 3 | 100 cm distance to sensor | -35 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor| Yes |
    | 4 | 5 cm distance to sensor | 90 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor | No|
    | 5 | 50 cm distance to sensor | -60 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor|No|
    | 6 | 350 cm distance to sensor | 0 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor| No |


5. Once the previous points are completed, add to Figure 1, **an I2C 16x2 LCD Display**, and place the image of the completed circuit up to this section.  

    **R:**

    </p> 

6. After completing the integration of the I2C Display, set the program that allows the display to show the following message, **"Target detected at ? Cm** and if detection is not achieved, indicate the message **"Target out of range"**.  

    **R:**  
    ```
    #include  <LiquidCrystal.h>

    // Pin to send the wave and collide with the objects
    const int trigPin = 9;
    // Pin to receive the sent wave
    const int echoPin = 10;
    // Initializer
    // CONSTRUCTOR FOR 16X2 LCD SCREEN
    // THE PINS FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE SCREEN ARE CONFIGURED HERE
    LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);


    void setup()
    {
        // WE INDICATE THAT WE HAVE A 16X2 SCREEN CONNECTED
        lcd.begin(16, 2);
  
        // We indicate the mode of the two pins
  
        //Pin trigPin modo salida
        pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
        //Pin echoPin modo entrada
        pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
        Serial.begin(9600);
  
    }

    void loop()
    {
        long duracion;
        long distancia;
        // We send a low pulse to the PIN trigPin
        digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
        // We indicate a delay of 2 microseconds
        delayMicroseconds(2);
  
        // We send a high pulse to the PIN trigPin
        digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
        // We indicate a delay of 10 microseconds
        delayMicroseconds(10);
        // Low pulse is sent to deactivate the sensor
        digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  
        // We assign the values registered by the input PIN
        duracion = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  
        // The cnoversion is carried out to obtain it in centimeters
        distancia = (duracion * 0.034) / 2;;  
        if(distancia != 332){
  	        lcd.clear();
  	        lcd.print("Objeto detectado");
  	        lcd.setCursor(0,1);
  	        lcd.print("a ");
  	        lcd.print(distancia);
  	        lcd.print(" cm");
        }
        else{
            lcd.clear();
            lcd.print("Objeto fuera");
            lcd.setCursor(0,1);
            lcd.print("de rango");
        }
        delay(500);
   
    }
    ```

9. Include the individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.
   
    **Hector Ivan Renteria Sanchez**  

    During the practice we carried out a simulation in which we placed the ultrasonic sensor that was indicated to us, for the first part of the circuit there were no problems, but when we did the part of connecting the LCD screen it was where it was complicated by all the connections that were had In this one, trying to investigate how they were carried out, we managed to make the connection but at the beginning there were many doubts about how the practice was going to be carried out, another thing I understood is that once connected this type of screens is quite easy to represent data graphically.


    **Issui Portillo Lara**  
    
    During this practice i learned how to use an ultrasonic sensor, how to measure the ranges of objects that were close to it, and how to connect the LCD screen, as well as configure it to be able to print information obtained in the circuit. I have been learning a lot in every practice, but at this moment i found this one more interesting as well, the one that made me have more doubts, but with my teamates help we could carry it out. 


    **Arturo Ulises Perez Lopez**  

    At the end of this practice I was understend how the Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 works and some applications for this sensor, that is very nice beacuse is very interesting how this works and I was learnd to program this sensor with Arduino one to displar on a LCD screen a mesagge to say how far is the object or if this not detect it. 


    **Gabriela Giselle Pereida Romo**  

    In the development of this practice I understood how to use an ultrasonic sensor, how the connection was made when adding the lcd screen. With the video provided and help from my teamates I managed to understand how the connections worked, the operation of the sensor, the range it has and how the lcd screen was configured to show the information that I received from the sensor in the circuit.
